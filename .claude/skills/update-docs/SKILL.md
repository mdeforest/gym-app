# Skill: Update Planning Docs

Review the following files and update them to reflect recent code or feature changes:

- `README.md`: Features, setup instructions, usage, deployment info
- `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`: Adjust goals, add important delivered features, refine user targets
- `docs/DESIGN.md`: Update UI structure, components, and design decisions
- `docs/FUTURE_FEATURES.md`: Remove finished features and make sure there are at least 5 future features. If there is not, add one feature that I may find useful.

Only modify what’s changed. Preserve tone and formatting.
