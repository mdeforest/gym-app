# Skill: Update Planning Docs

Review the following files and update them to reflect recent code or feature changes:

- `README.md`: Features, setup instructions, usage, deployment info
- `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`: Adjust goals, add delivered features, refine user targets
- `docs/DESIGN.md`: Update UI structure, components, and design decisions

Only modify what’s changed. Preserve tone and formatting.
